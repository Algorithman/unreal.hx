/**
  The Gesture class represents a recognized movement by the user.
  The Leap Motion Controller watches the activity within its field of view for certain
  movement patterns typical of a user gesture or command. For example, a movement from
  side to side with the hand can indicate a swipe gesture, while a finger poking forward
  can indicate a screen tap gesture.
