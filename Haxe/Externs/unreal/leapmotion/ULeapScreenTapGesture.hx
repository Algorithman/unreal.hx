  The ScreenTapGesture class represents a tapping gesture by a finger or tool.
  A screen tap gesture is recognized when the tip of a finger pokes forward and
  then springs back to approximately the original position, as if tapping a vertical
  screen. The tapping finger must pause briefly before beginning the tap.
