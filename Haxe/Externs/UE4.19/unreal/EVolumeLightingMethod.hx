    Lighting samples are computed in an adaptive grid which covers the entire Lightmass Importance Volume.  Higher density grids are used near geometry.
    The Volumetric Lightmap is interpolated efficiently on the GPU per-pixel, allowing accurate indirect lighting for dynamic objects and volumetric fog.
    Positions outside of the Importance Volume reuse the border texels of the Volumetric Lightmap (clamp addressing).
    On mobile, interpolation is done on the CPU at the center of each object's bounds.
